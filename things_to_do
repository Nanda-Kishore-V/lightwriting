run generation.py for combined segments (optimize later to only recompute sub-segments which were reversed)
for straight lines, use x(t) = x1 + t * (x2 - x1)/time if QP doesnt work.
add height offset to prevent quadrotors hitting the ground
Use homogeneous coordinates after position of camera is known.
Limit Segment combination to time and number of pieces per segment.

finish by Friday - simulation and find camera
last week - run demos on h/w
