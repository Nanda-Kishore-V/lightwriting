run generation.py for combined segments (optimize later to only recompute sub-segments which were reversed)
scale down simulated lengths of segments (from maybe 30m) to < 0.4m
implement JSON storage for data

finish by Friday - all s/w parts
do by next week - simulation
last week - run demos on h/w
