scale down simulated lengths of segments (from maybe 30m) to < 0.4m
for straight lines, use x(t) = x1 + t * (x2 - x1)/time if QP doesnt work.
add height offset to prevent quadrotors hitting the ground
change output of generation.py to .json

finish by Friday - all s/w parts
do by next week - simulation
last week - run demos on h/w
