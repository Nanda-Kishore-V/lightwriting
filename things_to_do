finish collision detection for trajectories - done
write script to combine all segments into single segment using metric (check how metric decreases and decide a threshold - maybe use number of quadrotors)
run generation.py for combined segments (optimize later to only recompute sub-segments which were reversed)
put colliding segments into different planes

finish by Friday - all s/w parts
do by next week - simulation
last week - run demos on h/w
