1) Use homogeneous coordinates after position of camera is known.
2) Change output of generation.py and input of form_pairs.py to .JSON
3) Remove unnecessary small straight lines formed by skeletonization at corners of letters
4) Unify the arena constants (3000px by 750px) present in run.sh and src/constants.py
5) Fix reversal of segments
6) Change decimation to detect straight lines and segment image accordingly
